# Firebase QRRooms

This repo provides a sample framework within which you can create multiplayer games that runs on one device and lets other users join the game by scanning a QR code using their device.

# To Setup

Create a firebase app.
Create a real time database.
Using your firebase credentials, update 'src/firebaseConfigSample.js', and rename it to 'src/firebaseConfig.js'.
Update the database rules to those found in 'src/dbrules.json'.
Turn on firebase auth and anonymous user accounts.

# To Run Locally

'cd' into the demo directory of your choice (demos explained below).
You can use 'python -m SimpleHTTPServer' to set up a local server.
Go to 'http://localhost:8000/' in your web browser.

## Demos:

demo_users: Bare bones implementation of creating a room and having users join/leave
demo_words: Word-based word-find game
demo_action: Action-based collecting-coins game
